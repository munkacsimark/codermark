# What freeCodeCamp gave me as an experienced developer — part 1

I’m a frontend developer approximately for 5 years. I knew what freeCodeCamp is, but I never looked into it. I decided to create a profile and go trough some lesson. 🏕👨‍💻

I wanted to see the difficulty and quality of lessons and also achieve certifications. 🙃 To my surprise, immediately in the first section (Responsive Web Design Certification) I found lessons from which I can learn new things.

## Responsive Web Design Certification

Like most of us, I started my career as an enthusiastic sitebuilder, therefore this section wasn’t so hard for me. I think it provides a good basis, but you can deeply learn CSS by a lot of practice. When I started to learn web programming, flexbox already existed, but we couldn’t use it in production because of poor browser support. I built my responsive sites with floats and clears of floats. Sometimes when the markup was complex it was really painful. 😅 Nowadays I’m using mostly flexbox instead of floating things, but I never used CSS Grid before. This lesson covers it and I’m happy to learn it’s basics. 😁 Modern browsers supports it quite good: [https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid)
