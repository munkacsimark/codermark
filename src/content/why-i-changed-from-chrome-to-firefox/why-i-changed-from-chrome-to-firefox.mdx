# Why I changed from Chrome to Firefox?

When in 2008, the first version of Chrome came out, I tried it and felt this is what can save mankind from Internet Explorer. I used it as my personal browser mostly because of its speed and I recommended it to my friends too. Then why I did change?

**The short answer:** Just for fun. ðŸ˜€

**The long answer:**
Of course I have tried and used many other browsers actively on many other platforms since Iâ€™m a front-end developer. I use a lot of Google products for personal purposes like Gmail/Inbox, Keep, Photos etc. I hate MS Office so I do my presentations or my docs with Slide and Docs in Google Drive. Well, I am an Android user, so Chrome seems to be the perfect digital ecosystem for me. It synchronizes everything and I can reach all of my documents from all of my devices. I also use Chrome for work because its developer tools are great and our products are based on Google products. ðŸ™‚

Last summer I was thinking about migrating to Firefox because I wanted to use it longer. On the one hand, I like [jumping out of my comfort zone](https://dev.to/agazaboklicka/are-you-programming-in-your-comfort-zone-please-dont-69i), on the other hand, many people love it and I can fully agree with their views. I found an [article](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/switch-chrome-firefox/) which helped me decide I want to use Firefox. I ported my saved passwords, bookmarks, RSS feeds, extensions (which were available) to Firefox (v54). I started to use Firefox as default browser on my phone as well. I love that I can use extensions on a mobile device too, I donâ€™t even know why Chrome didnâ€™t implement it yet. (I especially liked [Firefox Focus](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.focus), take a look at it!) The synchronizing worked nicely, everything was beautiful, but after about 2 weeks of use, I felt it annoyingly slow. It should be known that usually around 10â€“20 tabs are always open and I need them with all my extensions. It lagged when I switched between tabs, and the opening of the new tabs was so slow. So I moved back to Chrome againâ€¦

[Firefox Quantum](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/) was released recently, this is version #57. In this version the core engine was completely rewritten and they promised a very high speed. Meanwhile they have launched [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions), so they accept only extensions written in this way. Thus the extension that runs in Chrome runs in Firefox too, you only need to upload it into store. From a developerâ€™s perspective, an interesting information is that now [they automatically check the submitted extensions](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/09/21/review-wait-times-get-shorter/), so there are no 2-week delays. (My test extension needed 5 minutes.) That was enough for me to move back to Firefox again. Itâ€™s not as fast as they said on tests ([here](http://mashable.com/2017/11/15/google-chrome-vs-firefox-quantum/) and [here](http://www.zdnet.com/article/just-how-fast-is-firefox-quantum/)) and it didnâ€™t always beats Chrome but itâ€™s a big improvement compared to the previous versions. I can recommend it after 4 days of use to pro-users as well. It doesnâ€™t lag and the rendering seems a bit faster than in Chrome.

I am a happy Firefox user now and I donâ€™t miss Chrome so far. Maybe I only miss just the pinch gesture used on macOS at zooming, because this feature is missing from Firefox. (Or I just didnâ€™t find it in settings.)
